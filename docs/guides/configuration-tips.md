# Configuration tips

Here are some useful tips about how to configure your site...

## Site Metadata

Edit `docusaurus.config.js` to set `title`, `tagline`, and `url` for your website.

## GitHub Pages Deployment

Set up [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) by configuring the `GIT_USER` in `docusaurus.config.js` and running `yarn deploy`.

## Local Development

Start a local server with `yarn start` to preview changes instantly.

## Static Builds

Generate static files with `yarn build` for hosting on any static site service.

## Navigation Structure

Use `sidebars.js` to organize your documentation structure.
