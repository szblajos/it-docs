# Hello

I'm **Lajos Szabó**, Senior Software Developer. I created this site to explore the features of [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and improve my **IT documentation** skills.

## What I expect to earn

By working on this project, I hope to gain:

- A deeper understanding of Docusaurus and its customization options
- Improved skills in writing clear and structured technical documentation
- Experience with modern documentation workflows and tools
- A reusable template for future IT documentation projects

## Milestones

Milestones are previously set for me by my instructor: **Dávid Zsámboki** (Senior Technical Writer at [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/))

## The Goal

My goal, of course, is to complete the course. In addition, I want to improve my skills in IT documentation writing. Currently, I have to prepare a lot of technical documentation, and I want to deliver the best possible quality in this area as well.
